Task 1)\\
Plots of the glcms of the 4 textures for each direction:\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{"task1_d1"}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{"task1_d2"}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{"task1_d3"}\\
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{"task1_d4"}\\
\ \\
I don't think one direction will be enough to discriminate between all the textures. Because for all the directions at least two of the textures have very similar glcms.\\
Therefore i will chose two directions. As for which directions, i think dx=1,dy=0 and dx=0,dy=-1 will give a good chance for differentiating the textures.\\
Because each pair of textures are different in at least one direction.\\
(for convenience i will from now on call dx=1,dy=0 for d1. And dx=0,dy=-1 for d2)\\
e.g. texture 1 and 4 are different in both d1 and d2. But texture 1 and 2 are different in d1 but quite similar in d2.\\
Also texture 2 and 3 are quite different from themselves when comparing d1 and d2.\\
These differences between d1 and d2 should give us a lot of good information to give the classifier.\\
